# Think!

Think! is a fast-paced, ad-free trivia battle game where you can challenge your friends and learn new things along the way!

## Why I Created Think!

I love trivia games, but when I tried playing **Trivia Crack**, I found the ads overwhelming and the interface too busy. Within minutes, I deleted the app. Thatâ€™s when I decided to build my own trivia gameâ€”one that focuses on pure fun, competition, and learning, without annoying distractions.

- **Simple & Clean Interface** â€“ No clutter, just an intuitive and engaging game.

## How to Play

1. Invite a friend or match with a random opponent.
2. Answer trivia questions as fast and accurately as possible.
3. Score points and outsmart your opponent to win the round.
4. Keep playing, keep learning, and become the ultimate trivia champion!
